              Whales are large marine mammals known for their size,
              intelligence, and diverse species. They belong to the order
              Cetacea, which includes two main groups: baleen whales (Mysticeti)
              and toothed whales (Odontoceti). Baleen whales, like the blue
              whale (the largest animal on Earth), filter small organisms such
              as krill from seawater using baleen plates, while toothed whales,
              such as sperm whales and orcas, hunt fish and squid. Whales are
              known for their complex vocalizations and long migrations. They
              play a critical role in maintaining marine ecosystems and are
              protected in many parts of the world due to conservation efforts.

              Deer are majestic creatures, embodying grace and elegance in their
              movements. With slender bodies, large expressive eyes, and
              impressive antlers, they exude a regal presence in their natural
              habitats. Their gentle nature and quiet demeanor captivate
              observers, making them symbols of the wild and representing the
              harmony of nature. In many cultures, deer are seen as a connection
              to the spirit world, enhancing their majestic reputation.

              Elephants are powerful creatures, the largest land mammals on
              Earth. Their immense size allows them to uproot trees and push
              heavy obstacles with ease. Weighing between 5,000 to 14,000
              pounds, their strong trunks serve as versatile tools for lifting
              and manipulating objects. This strength, combined with their
              intelligence, enables elephants to shape their environment and
              influence the wildlife around them.

              Leopards are incredibly agile, able to climb trees effortlessly
              and leap up to 20 feet. Their quick reflexes enable sharp turns
              while chasing prey, and they move silently through dense
              vegetation to stalk their targets. This agility makes them
              formidable predators in their natural habitats.
